# FOCAL Minimal Landing Page
A single-file Tailwind landing page with a dark, grid background to match your dashboard screenshots.

## Quick Start
1. Serve `index.html` with any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, S3).
2. Replace links:
   - Calendly: search for `your-calendly` and replace.
   - Email: replace `adithya@yourdomain` with your domain email (e.g., adithya@focal.llc).
   - One-Pager: upload `Focal_One_Pager.pdf` at the site root (or change the link).
3. Replace the screenshot image at `assets/placeholder-dashboard.png` with your actual screenshot (keep the filename or update the src).
4. Optional: set up a custom domain (e.g., focal.llc) to point at your hosting provider.
